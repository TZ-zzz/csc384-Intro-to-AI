1. The first thing we should do is checking deadlocks. If there is a box at a corner and not in the storage point, or
    it is at a wall but no storage points along the same wall, the state won't reach the goal which means we need to
    prune these states. Also, combinations of obstacle, boxes and walls can also lead to deadlocks, avoid as much as
    you can.

2. When robots are not near boxes that not in storages, they will move without pushing boxes. We need to make them approach
    those boxes instead of just wandering around without purpose and wasting time.

2. We need to make heuristic function efficient to keep time. One easiest way is creating a hash table and each time
    the search engine meets states with same locations of boxes (only robots moved), we only need to look up the information
    instead of calculate it again.
